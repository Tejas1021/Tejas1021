<h2><font style="color:lime"><u>HOW IT SPREADS</u>:</font></h2>
<h3><font style="color:blue">
<li>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated,<br>
when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. <br>
<li>These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.<br>
<li>You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone <br>
who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.<br>
</font></h3>
<br><br>
<h2><font style="color:lime"><u>Symptoms</u>:</font></h2>
<font style="color:white">
COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.
<br>
<u>Most common symptoms</u>:
<li>fever
<li>dry cough
<li>tiredness
<br>
<u>Less common symptoms</u>:

<h2><font style="color:lime"><u>Prevention</u>:</font></h2>
<font style="color:white">
Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. <br>
Follow advice provided by your local health authority.<br><br>
<u>To prevent the spread of COVID-19</u>:<br>
<li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
<li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
<li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
<li>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
<li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
<li>Stay home if you feel unwell.
<li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
<li>Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. <br>
<li>This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
<br>
<u>Masks</u>:<br>
Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. <br>
Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. <br>
Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.<br>
