Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), a specific type of coronavirus.Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. 
Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. Longer-term damage to 
organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed, and there is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered 
from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—including severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive 
issues, low grade fever, muscle weakness, breathlessness, and other symptoms—for months afterwards.COVID-19 mainly spreads through the air 
when people are near each other, primarily via small droplets or aerosols, as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks. 
Transmission via contaminated surfaces has not been conclusively demonstrated, so the currently-known main mode of transmission is airborne. 
It can spread from an infected person for up to two days before symptoms appear (presymptomatic), and from an infected person who is asymptomatic. 
People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases. The standard diagnosis method is by real-time 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab.
The virus has caused an ongoing pandemic. Preventive measures include social distancing, quarantine, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, 
and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of 
transmissions.There are no proven vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19 yet, though several are in development. Management involves the 
treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.
